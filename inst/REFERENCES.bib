 abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of a longitudinal multi-center clinical trial with missing data. It illustrates the application, the appropriateness, and the limitations of a straightforward ratio estimation procedure for dealing with multivariate situations in which missing data occur at random and with small probability. The parameter estimates are computed via matrix operators such as those used for the generalized least squares analysis of categorical data. Thus, the estimates may be conveniently analyzed by asymptotic regression methods within the same computer program which computes the estimates, provided that the sample size is sufficiently large.},
